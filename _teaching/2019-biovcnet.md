Instructor for [Bioinformatics Virtual Coordination Network](https://biovcnet.github.io/_pages/people/) 
Many research laboratories shut down due to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. This leaves academics at all levels in a difficult position - where research in the lab may not resume for many months. We are a group of bioinformaticians and computational biologists committed to helping wet-lab biologists pick up some computational skills/begin computational projects during this global crisis.
