# Teaching Resources

This is a collection of some of my writings and teaching resources:

- [Evidence your teaching with data depositories](https://philip-leftwich.github.io/teaching/Evidence-teaching)

- [THE campus](https://philip-leftwich.github.io/teaching/THE-campus)

- [Benchling for Education](https://philip-leftwich.github.io/teaching/Benchling-for-Education)

- [Dry Labs Real Science](https://philip-leftwich.github.io/teaching/Dry%20Labs-Real%20Science)

 
 
 You can also check out the community page I curate on Zenodo for [Biosciences Teaching and Education Research at the University of East Anglia](https://zenodo.org/communities/uea-bio-teaching)

# Books

[Maths Skills for A-level Biology](https://philip-leftwich.github.io/teaching/maths-skills-for-a-level-biology)
  I wrote a book - and it has some decent reviews. This is a primer for the maths you need to succeed as a biologist at A-level, but in my opinion also a handy reosurce for early undegraduates as well.

# Workshops and Courses

[Physalia Courses: Introduction to Statistics in R for Biologists and Ecologists](https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/course13/)
  I run courses in Programming and Statistics with the excellent Physalia courses, check out their page (or here) for past and future workshops.

[Bioinformatics Virtual Coordination Network](https://philip-leftwich.github.io/teaching/2019-biovcnet)
  A product of lockdown, as a group of Early Career Research Bioinformaticians and Data Scientists we got together to help wet-lab biologists pick up some computational skills/begin computational projects. 


# Other Resources

[A collection of useful guides written by others on writing, publishing, and reproducible science](https://philip-leftwich.github.io/teaching/other-resources)
